# INTERVIEW-PROCESSING-SYSTEM

## Project Introduction

The Automated Interview Process Tool is designed to streamline the recruitment process for technical roles by assessing candidates' coding skills in a comprehensive and automated manner. It evaluates multiple aspects of the candidate's responses, such as the complexity, maintainability, and confidence of their code. By utilizing advanced metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), Weighted Composite Complexity (WCC), and Cognitive Functional Size (CFC), the tool offers an objective measure of a candidate's ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. This system is beneficial for both technical interviews and candidate shortlisting.

## Features

1. **Code Complexity Evaluation**: Assesses the complexity of a candidate's code using metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), Weighted Composite Complexity (WCC), and Cognitive Functional Size (CFC). These metrics help in determining how intricate or simple the code is and its suitability for long-term maintenance.
   
2. **Code Maintainability Evaluation**: Measures how easy it is to maintain and modify the candidate’s code based on industry-standard metrics and best practices.
   
3. **Confidence and Personality Evaluation**: Analyzes the candidate's confidence level, tone, and pitch during the interview, helping to understand their communication style and assertiveness.

4. **Automated Scoring**: Automatically calculates scores for candidates based on their code complexity and maintainability, which can be used to shortlist candidates for further rounds of the interview.

5. **Gamified Problem Solving**: Integrates gamified assessments to evaluate technical problem-solving skills and creativity under pressure.

6. **Video-Based Assessment**: Analyzes the candidate’s body language and video presentation to assess clarity, posture, and professional demeanor during the interview.
